# msw-when-then

A non-invasive '`when-then`' style API for [MSW](https://mswjs.io/).

## Why?

I like to explicitly keep mocks in each test so that it is clear what is going on.
[MSW](https://mswjs.io/) is a brilliant tool for mocking, but I find it is a little too verbose when writing tests.
msw-when-then aims to help with that.
