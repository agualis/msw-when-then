## Why

[MSW](https://mswjs.io/) is a brilliant tool for mocking, but is missing a few things to make it perfect for testing.
msw-when-then aims to help with that by providing a thin layer on top of MSW with additional APIs.

## Notable Features

Here are a few features that we think make msw-when-then useful.

- [Succinct "when-then" style Api](examples_basic.md)
- [Mock Chaining](features_mock-chaining.md)
- [Implicitly assert request data is correct](docs/features_request-assertions.md)

## Want to give it a go?

Msw-when-then is non-invasive. This means that you can give it a go without changing any of your existing configuration or setup.
